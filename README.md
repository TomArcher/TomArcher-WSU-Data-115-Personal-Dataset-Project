# WSU Data 115 Personal Dataset Project

In this project, I'm leveraging R and Microsoft Excel to analyze some key metrics for software developers and how those metrics differ between various demographics.

**Notes**
- The analysis is performed on [2021 survey data](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) of 80,000 respondents.
- References to gender and sexual identity are based on the values supplied by the individual participants of the surveys on which my analysis is based.

**Example questions I'm analyzing**
- What is the pay difference for software developers between men and women?
- How does job satisfaction compare between software developers in the U.S. vs. the rest of the world, and between men and women?
- How does LGBTQ+ representation among software developers compare to the general public?
